# AirStream

A fictional minimalist social network.

## About

This is an example project written to compare the strengths and weaknesses of jQuery and AngularJS, as well as reviewing migration strategies.

The [jQuery](http://daniellmb.github.io/airstream/jquery) version of airstream uses [Sammy.js](http://sammyjs.org) for basic routing support, and [Mustache.js](http://mustache.github.io/) for templating. The [AngularJS](http://daniellmb.github.io/airstream/angular) version of the site provides the same functionality as the jQuery version, but only relies on the core AngularJS libraries.

## Testing

Unit tests can be run with the `npm test` command.
